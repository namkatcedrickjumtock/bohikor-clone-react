                By Law or to Protect Rights <br className='my-2' />

                If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to
                investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and

                information with third parties for marketing purposes, as permitted by law.
                Interactions with Other Users <br className='my-2' />
                If you interact with other users of the Application, those users may see your name, profile photo,
                and descriptions of your activity, including sending invitations to other users, chatting with other
                users, liking posts, and following blogs.
                Third-Party Advertisers <br className='my-2' />
                We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Application.
                These companies may use information about your visits to the Application and other websites
                that are contained in web cookies in order to provide advertisements about goods and services
                of interest to you. <br className='my-2' />
                Affiliates
                We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates
                to honor this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint

                We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain products,

                Offer Wall
                The Application may display a third-party-hosted “offer wall.” Such an offer wall allows
                third-party advertisers to offer virtual currency, gifts, or other items to users in return for
                acceptance and completion of an advertisement offer. Such an offer wall may appear in the
                Application and be displayed to you based on certain data, such as your geographic area or
                demographic information. When you click on an offer wall, you will leave the Application. A
                unique identifier, such as your user ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider in order to
                prevent fraud and properly credit your account.  <br className='my-2' />
                Other Third Parties
                We may share your information with advertisers and investors for the purpose of conducting

                marketing purposes, as permitted by law. <br className='my-2' />
                Sale or Bankruptcy
                If we reorganize or sell all or a portion of our assets, undergo a merger, or are acquired by
                another entity, we may transfer your information to the successor entity. If we go out of
                business or enter bankruptcy, your information would be an asset transferred or acquired by a
                third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that the transferee may decline
                to honor commitments we made in this Privacy Policy. <br className='my-2' />
                We are not responsible for the actions of third parties with whom you share personal or
                sensitive data, and we have no authority to manage or control third-party solicitations. If you no
                longer wish to receive correspondence, emails or other communications from third parties, you
                are responsible for contacting the third party directly
            </p>

                TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES <br className='my-2' />
                Cookies and Web Beacons <br className='my-2' />
                We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies on the
                Application to help customize the Application and improve your experience. When you access
                the Application, your personal information is not collected through the use of tracking
                technology. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can remove or reject
                cookies, but be aware that such action could affect the availability and functionality of the
                Application. You may not decline web beacons. However, they can be rendered ineffective by
                declining all cookies or by modifying your web browser’s settings to notify you each time a
                cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis
                Internet-Based Advertising <br className='my-2' />
                Additionally, we may use third-party software to serve ads on the Application, implement email
                marketing campaigns, and manage other interactive marketing initiatives. This third-party
                software may use cookies or similar tracking technology to help manage and optimize your
                online experience with us. For more information about opting out of interest-based ads, visit the
                Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out Tool or Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Tool.
                Website Analytics <br className='my-2' />
                We may also partner with selected third-party vendors, such as Google Analytics to allow
                tracking technologies and remarketing services on the Application through the use of first-party
                cookies and third-party cookies, to, among other things, analyze and track users’ use of the
                Application, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand online activity. By
                accessing the Application, you consent to the collection and use of your information by these
                third-party vendors. You are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly
                for responses to your questions. We do not transfer personal information to these third-party
                vendors. <br className='my-2' />
                You should be aware that getting a new computer, installing a new browser, upgrading an
                existing browser, or erasing or otherwise altering your browser’s cookies files may also clear
                certain opt-out cookies, plug-ins, or settings.
            </p>

            <p>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES <br className='my-2' />
                The Application may contain links to third-party websites and applications of interest, including
                advertisements and external services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these
                links to leave the Application, any information you provide to these third parties is not covered
                by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information.
                Before visiting and providing any information to any third-party websites, you should inform
                yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third-party responsible for that
                website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your
                information. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and
                policies of any third parties, including other sites, services, or applications that may be linked to
                or from the Application.</p>

            <p>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION <br className='my-2' />
                We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal
                information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you
                provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or
                impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception
                or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and
                misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you
                provide personal information.</p>

            <p>POLICY FOR CHILDREN <br className='my-2' />
                We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 18. If you
                become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us
                using the contact information provided below.</p>
            <p>
                CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES <br className='my-2' />
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and our mobile applications include a
                Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
                have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology
                standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
                currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
                communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
                that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
                this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

                    <p>CAMEROON PRIVACY RIGHTS
                        In the preamble to the Constitution of the Republic of Cameroon, Law No. 96/6 of 18 January
                        1996 revising the Constitution of 02 June 1972, as amended and supplemented by Law No.
                        2008/001 of 14 April 2008 (‘the Constitution’), it is stated that:</p>
                    <li> the people of Cameroon affirm their attachment to the fundamental freedoms enshrined
                        in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1945, the Charter of the United Nations
                        1945, the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights 1981, which are all duly ratified;</li>
                    <li> international conventions relating thereto;</li>
                    <li> freedom and security are guaranteed to every individual with due respect for the rights of
                        others and the best interests of the State;</li>
                    <li> privacy of all correspondence is inviolable – no interference may be allowed except as
                        provided in a judicial decision.</li>
                    <p>Data protection is, therefore, a right enshrined in the Constitution. <br className='my-2' />
